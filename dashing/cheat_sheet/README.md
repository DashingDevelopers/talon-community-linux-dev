#Talon Voice Commands Cheatsheet


1. Have talon installed on your computer following the instructions at [talonvoice.com](https://talonvoice.com/docs/index.html#getting-started)
2. Have this repo cloned  into the user directory of ~/talon.  This makes these scripts available to talon.
3. Say "print cheatsheet" or Open the talon repl and type

```
actions.user.cheatsheet()
```

Then open the cheatsheet.html file in your browser.  You can also print it to have a hard copy.
The HTML includes page breaks, so it should come out fairly nicely.

Future features:

Add a way to print  A cheat seat from a single user context to cater for
new user Repositories and applications.
It might just be easier to generate individual HTML files per thing. So that Now configuration is required.
