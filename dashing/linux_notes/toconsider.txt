alternative paste method
in case anyone else is finding the actions.user.paste() problematic (too slow) on linux, you can use this replacement code in code/edit.py in the interim, which seems to be work fine based on testing (not sure if someone posted another workaround already):

@mod.action_class
class Actions:
    def paste(text: str):
        """Pastes text and preserves clipboard"""
        #with clip.revert():
        #    clip.set_text(text)
        #    actions.edit.paste()
        #    # sleep here so that clip.revert doesn't revert the clipboard too soon
        #    actions.sleep("150ms")
        # TODO: qt clipboard is bugged, do it manually
        old = subprocess.check_output(['xclip', '-o', '-sel', 'clip'])
        clip.set_text(text)
        actions.edit.paste()
        actions ("150ms")
        clip.set_text(old.decode("utf-8"))
